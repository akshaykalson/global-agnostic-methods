# Explorable ML Exercise

This Python program includes implementations and demonstrations of various techniques and concepts in machine learning, focusing on model explainability and evaluation.

## Files and Content:

- `Explainable ML_exercise 5.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code with explanations and demonstrations of techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for model interpretation, building and training neural network models with TensorFlow/Keras, and using XGBoost for regression tasks.

- `fueleconomy.xlsx`: Excel file containing the dataset used in the notebook for demonstration purposes.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - xgboost
  - shap
  - plot_keras_history

## Usage:

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:


3. Download the `fueleconomy.xlsx` file and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

4. Open the Jupyter notebook `Explainable ML_exercise 5.ipynb` and execute the code cells sequentially to observe demonstrations of various machine learning techniques.

## Notes:

- Make sure to read the comments in the notebook for explanations of each code section and technique.

- Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different parameters or datasets to further explore and understand the concepts presented.
